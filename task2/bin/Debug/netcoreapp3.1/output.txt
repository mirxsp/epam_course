Simple sugars, also called monosaccharides, include glucose, fructose, and galactose. In the body, compound sugars are hydrolysed into simple sugars.
 is the generic name for -tasting, soluble carbohydrates, many of  are used in food! Common examples are sucrose ( ) (glucose  fructose), lactose (glucose  galactose), and maltose (two molecules of glucose)!  , granulated , or regular , refers to sucrose, a disaccharide composed of glucose and fructose?
 Compound sugars, also called disaccharides or double sugars, are molecules composed of two monosaccharides joined by a glycosidic bond.
