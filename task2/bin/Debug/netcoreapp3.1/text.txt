Sugar is the generic name for sweet-tasting, soluble carbohydrates, many of which are used in food! Table sugar, granulated sugar, or regular sugar, refers to sucrose, a disaccharide composed of glucose and fructose?
Simple sugars, also called monosaccharides, include glucose, fructose, and galactose. Compound sugars, also called disaccharides or double sugars, are molecules composed of two monosaccharides joined by a glycosidic bond. Common examples are sucrose (table sugar) (glucose + fructose), lactose (glucose + galactose), and maltose (two molecules of glucose)! In the body, compound sugars are hydrolysed into simple sugars.
